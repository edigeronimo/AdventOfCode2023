Most days are implemented in C#. The Program class creates the day to run and calls either Part1() or Part2(). Adjust that to run the challenge you want.

In each Day's Part1/Part2 functions, it reads a file near the start. Adjust that filename to supply test or real input data.

Day 12 part 2 C# solution will take weeks to run. Probably a lot of weeks. Day 12 part 2 C++ will take over a week on a Ryzen 7950X, but should finish.

Day 25 is a brute force solution. I have no idea how long it will take to run, probably a very long time.
